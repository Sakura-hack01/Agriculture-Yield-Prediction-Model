# Crop Production


## Project Overview

This project aimed to forecast crop yields using machine learning techniques and visualize the results through interactive dashboards. The focus was on identifying key environmental and agricultural factors such as rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, that influence crop productivity. A structured methodology was followed starting from data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing to model development using Random Forest Regression, which demonstrated high predictive accuracy. The model also provided insights into feature importance, helping to identify the most influential factors affecting crop yields. To make the results easily interpretable and useful for decision-making, Power BI was used to build interactive dashboards. These visualizations enabled comparison across regions, evaluation of trends, and support for data-driven agricultural policy and planning.
This helps to assist farmers, agronomists, and policymakers in decision-making and yield improvement.
